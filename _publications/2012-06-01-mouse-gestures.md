abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. Approaches for multistroke mouse gestures support are considered in this paper. Presented way of gestures implementation is oriented on creation of new elements on a scene or diagram in meta-CASE system. We propose to generate examples of mouse gestures for elements and to allow user create elements by fast mouse move. We present numerical comparison of gestures recognition algorithms before and after training by k-means algorithm. The proposed approach is implemented in QReal meta-CASE-system.</p>"
