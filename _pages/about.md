I am a PhD candidate at MIT CSAIL advised by [Polina Golland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/). My research focuses on medical image analysis, particularly robust and interpretable techniques for both generative and discriminative models. I also work on 3D vision, including neural fields and trajectory estimation. I use diffusion models to make [things](#fun-ai-creations-more).

I previously worked with [Jim Duncan](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/james_duncan/) and [Julius Chapiro](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/julius_chapiro/) in the [Yale Radiology Research Lab](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/radresearch/), and interned at [Iterative Scopes](https://www.iterativescopes.com/). I am supported by the [Takeda Fellowship](https://mittakedaprogram.mit.edu/) and [Siebel Scholarship](http://www.siebelscholars.com/). I received a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering at Yale, where I did research with [Stuart Campbell](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/stuart-campbell).
