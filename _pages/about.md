<!-- ## About Me -->

I am currently a second-year master student in Computer Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), where I am conducting research on reinforcement learning and spiking neural networks as part of the [AdvanCed Computing aNd SysTem Laboratory](https://www.ccnt.zju.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Gang Pan](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/gpan). Previously, I received my B.Eng. (Hons.) in Information Engineering from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) in June 2021. During that period, I did research on communication optimization at [National Mobile Communications Research Lab](https://ncrl.seu.edu.cn/), advised by [A.P. Liang Wu](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/newenglish/wl_en/main.htm). 

My research interests lie in developing principled and efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, particularly in multi-agent systems, as well as exploring RL applications in other AI domains and real-world challenges. I also work on the spiking neural network, including combating spike-oriented gradient vanishing and optimizing the network structure. 

You can find my CV [here](/files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
