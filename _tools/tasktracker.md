abstract: '<p><b>TaskTracker</b> is an IntelliJ-based IDE plugin for tracking code changes while solving programming problems. TaskTracker tracks changes made in code during problem solving. We use this data to analyze programming patterns of students and collect diverse sets of solutions for programming problems. For example, we are building an automated hint generation system based on this data. On startup, TaskTracker asks the user to specify their age and programming experience. The UI of TaskTracker enables the user to choose a problem to solve and see correct examples of desired behavior. All data about problems is received from the TaskTracker server when the plugin starts. Currently TaskTracker is available in English and Russian.</p>'
