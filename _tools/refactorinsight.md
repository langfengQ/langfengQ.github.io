abstract: '<p><b>RefactorInsight</b> is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that enhances the representation of code changes with refactoring information in Java and Kotlin projects. The plugin introduces a smart diff for code changes in Java and Kotlin where refactorings are auto-folded and provided with their description, thus allowing users to focus on changes that modify the code behavior like bug fixes and new  features. RefactorInsight supports three usage scenarios: viewing smart diffs with auto-folded refactorings and hints, inspecting refactorings in pull requests and at any specific commit in the project change history, and exploring the refactoring history of methods and classes.</p>'
