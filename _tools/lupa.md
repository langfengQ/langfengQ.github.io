tag: 'A framework for the large scale analysis of programming language usage.'
abstract: '<p><b>Lupa</b> is an extendable framework for analyzing fine-grained language usage on the base of the IntelliJ Platform. Lupa is a command line tool that uses the power of the IntelliJ Platform under the hood to perform code analysis using the same industry-level tools that are employed in IntelliJ-based IDEs, such as IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, or CLion. Currently, our framework supports analyzing two languages: Python — a mature language most popular in data science and machine learning, and Kotlin — a relatively young but quickly growing language.</p>'
