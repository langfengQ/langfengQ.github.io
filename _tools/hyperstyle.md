abstract: "<p><b>Hyperstyle</b> is a tool for detecting code quality issues in the students' submissions on massive open online courses. To make it reflect the needs of the programming community and at the same time be easily extendable, we built it upon several existing professional linters and code checkers. Hyperstyle supports four programming languages (Python, Java, Kotlin, and Javascript) and can be used as a standalone tool or integrated into a MOOC platform. We have integrated the tool into two educational platforms, Stepik and JetBrains Academy, and it has been used to process about one million submissions every week since May 2021.</p>"
