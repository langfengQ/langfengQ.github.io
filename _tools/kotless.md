tag: 'Kotlin serverless framework that aims to reduce the routine of serverless deployment creation by generating it straight from the code of the application itself.'
abstract: '<p><b>Kotless</b> is a Kotlin serverless framework. Kotless is a cloud-agnostic toolkit that solves these problems by interweaving the deployed application into the cloud infrastructure and automatically generating the necessary deployment code. This relieves developers from having to spend their time integrating and managing their applications instead of developing them. Kotless has proven its capabilities and has been used to develop several serverless applications already in production.</p>'
