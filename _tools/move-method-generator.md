abstract: '<p><b>MoveMethodGenerator</b> is a tool for generating a dataset of potentially movable functions which can introduce a Feature Envy smell when moved. The tool returns a list of all methods that can be moved from their class to some other class in the project. Each entry in this list is a value containing a method, its original class, and a nonzero number of other classes this method can be placed to.</p>'
