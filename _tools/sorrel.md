abstract: '<p><b>Sorrel</b> is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA for managing licenses and detecting license incompatibilities. The plugin scans the project in search of information about the project license and licenses of its libraries. If the project does not have a license yet, the plugin provides the developer with recommendations for choosing the most suitable open license, and if there is a license, it informs the programmer about potential licensing violations. The tool makes it easier for developers to choose a proper license for a project and avoid most of the licensing errors ‚Äî all inside the familiar IDE editor.</p>'
