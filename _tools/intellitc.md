tag: 'A plugin for IntelliJ IDEA for carrying out type migration in Java.'
abstract: "<p><b>IntelliTC</b> is a tool to perform Java type change refactoring. We implemented it as a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, a popular Java IDE developed by JetBrains. We present 3 different ways of providing support for such a refactoring from the standpoint of the user experience: Classic mode, Suggested Refactoring, and Inspection mode. To evaluate these modalities of using IntelliTC, we surveyed 15 experienced software developers. They positively rated the usefulness of the tool.</p>"
