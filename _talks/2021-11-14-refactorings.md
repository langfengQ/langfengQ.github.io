abstract: "Refactoring has been with us for more than two decades already. Multiple papers are being published every year on the detection of code smells and recommendations of refactoring opportunities. Many of these papers report very high quality of their approaches, so reading them often leaves me wondering, why don't we see features like this in our development tools? In this talk, I am going to tell a story of how we migrated refactoring recommendation prototypes into IntelliJ Platform: how data-driven IDE features are being born, what challenges we usually face while doing it, and how this could be useful to researchers."
